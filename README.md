## Overview  
StreamMesh provides a **high-performance browser streaming platform** capable of rendering interactive, GPU-accelerated experiences using modern web technologies.  

Its architecture includes:  
- **React + TypeScript** for frontend structure and interactivity  
- **WebGL/WebGPU + WebAssembly (WASM)** for high-performance graphics rendering  
- **Node.js (Express)** backend for stream handling  
- **Java microservices** for additional processing and data orchestration  
- **PostgreSQL** for asset and user data storage  
- **S3 Integration** for media storage and delivery  
- **CDN caching** (Cloudflare/Akamai) for optimized content delivery
